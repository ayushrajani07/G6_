# Wave 3 Delivery Summary (2025-10-08)

## 1. Objectives Recap
Advance pipeline promotion readiness by improving parity fidelity, adding rolling observability, automating performance regression detection, strengthening rollback safety, and formalizing phase contracts & taxonomy counters.

## 2. Delivered Scope
| Area | Deliverable | Artifact / Code | Notes |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Parity Scoring | Extended parity version 2 (strike coverage component) | `src/collectors/pipeline/parity.py` | Enabled via `G6_PARITY_EXTENDED=1` |
| Rolling Observability | Rolling parity window + gauge | parity `record_parity_score`, gauge `g6_pipeline_parity_rolling_avg` | Window set by `G6_PARITY_ROLLING_WINDOW` |
| Alert Parity | Severity-weighted alert parity component + diff gauge | parity scoring + `g6_pipeline_alert_parity_diff` | Weights: `G6_PARITY_ALERT_WEIGHTS` |
| Phase Contracts | Comprehensive phase table | `PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` Section 3 | Inputs/outputs/failures/retry |
| Benchmark Automation | `bench_delta` script for delta thresholds & gating | `scripts/bench_delta.py` | Supports CI regression fail-fast |
| Rollback Drill | Artifact persistence + metrics counter | `scripts/rollback_drill.py` | Counter `g6_pipeline_rollback_drill_total` |
| Taxonomy Metrics | Recoverable / fatal counters | `pipeline_expiry_recoverable_total`, `pipeline_index_fatal_total` | Facade: `dump_metrics`, `get_counter` |
| Alert Aggregation Integration | Snapshot alerts -> parity structured categories | `pipeline.run_pipeline` | Enables per-category weighting |
| Documentation | Operator & design updates | `OPERATOR_MANUAL.md`, `PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` | Includes env vars & gauges |

## 3. Environment Flags Added / Extended
- `G6_PARITY_EXTENDED` – enable strike coverage component (version=2)
- `G6_PARITY_ROLLING_WINDOW` – rolling score window length (disable if <2)
- `G6_PARITY_ALERT_WEIGHTS` – comma list `cat:weight` for alert severity weighting
- `G6_BENCH_METRICS` – (optional) emit metrics during bench delta run

## 4. New / Updated Metrics & Gauges
| Metric | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `g6_pipeline_parity_rolling_avg` | Gauge | Rolling parity score average |
| `g6_pipeline_alert_parity_diff` | Gauge | Weighted normalized alert mismatch fraction |
| `pipeline_expiry_recoverable_total` | Counter | Expiry-level recoverable failures |
| `pipeline_index_fatal_total` | Counter | Index-level fatal failures |
| `g6_pipeline_rollback_drill_total` | Counter | Rollback drill executions |

## 5. Promotion Gate Impact
| Gate | Change | Current Status |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Parity Score | Rolling window instrumentation added | Data collection ready |
| Alert Parity | Weighted mismatch support (stricter signal) | Mechanism implemented |
| Performance Deltas | Automation harness executes & evaluates | Threshold integration ready |
| Taxonomy Adoption | Counters surfaced; failure paths instrumented | Partial (needs broader exception mapping) |
| Rollback Readiness | Drill artifacts + counter | Improved; legacy invocation still simple |

## 6. Test Coverage Additions
- Extended parity + rolling window tests: `tests/test_pipeline_parity_extended_and_rolling.py`
- Logging & parity log verification: `tests/test_pipeline_logging.py`
- Taxonomy counters discovery: `tests/test_pipeline_taxonomy_counters.py`

## 7. Known Gaps / Deferred to Wave 4
| Gap | Rationale | Planned Action |
|-----|-----------|----------------|
| Full taxonomy refactor (all phases) | Incremental risk to stability | Map remaining broad exceptions + per-phase classification |
| Alert severity taxonomy standardization | Need production frequency data | Add severity labels + panel surfaces |
| Parity weighting tuning | Need empirical distribution | Collect baseline distributions then adjust weights config default |
| Benchmark artifact metrics emission | Optional for CI only now | Add Prom summary & thresholds as gauges |
| Legacy shim cleanup | Avoid churn mid-promotion | Remove after parity >= target sustained |
| Retry/backoff instrumentation | Lower immediate ROI | Add per-phase retry counters & histogram buckets |

## 8. Operational Playbook Deltas
- Use `G6_PARITY_ALERT_WEIGHTS` to focus on higher-impact alert categories (e.g., `index_failure` > coverage drift).
- Monitor `g6_pipeline_alert_parity_diff` alongside rolling parity average for early divergence.
- Include rollback drill counter in weekly operations review.

## 9. Suggested Dash Panel Additions
| Panel | Query Sketch | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Rolling Parity | `g6_pipeline_parity_rolling_avg` | Promotion gate tracking |
| Alert Parity Diff | `g6_pipeline_alert_parity_diff` | Alert parity drift |
| Taxonomy Failures | `increase(pipeline_index_fatal_total[1h])` | Fatal spike detection |
| Recoverable Rate | `increase(pipeline_expiry_recoverable_total[1h])` | Stability noise filter |
| Rollback Drill Count | `rate(g6_pipeline_rollback_drill_total[24h])` | Run frequency audit |

## 10. Wave 4 Preview (Draft Scope)
| Theme | Candidate Work Items |
|-------|----------------------|
| Taxonomy Completion | Map remaining broad exceptions; per-phase categorized metrics; add fatal ratio alert |
| Alert Severity & Panels | Standard severity labels; alert severity weighting defaults; dashboard grouping |
| Performance & Resource | Phase retry/backoff metrics; memory footprint sampling gauge; high-percentile latency correlation panels |
| Parity Deep Dive | Distributional parity (strike ladder shape, coverage variance); optional index weighting |
| Benchmark Evolution | Integrate bench deltas into regular cycle metrics; publish comparison panel |
| Cleanup & Deprecation | Retire legacy parity harness parts; remove tombstoned tests; prune deep metric import paths |
| Ops Tooling | CLI to dump latest rolling parity + alert diff JSON; structured anomaly classification event |

## 11. Acceptance / Exit Criteria for Wave 3
All committed features merged, no failing tests, documentation updated, and new gauges visible (where metrics stack is available). This document serves as the ratified closure artifact.
