# G6 Platform Cleanup & Governance Final Report (Scaffold)

_Date: 2025-10-05_

> Status: INITIAL SCAFFOLD. Populate metric deltas & narrative before public circulation.

## 1. Executive Summary

Provide a concise 5â€“8 sentence summary: scope, key achievements (SSE consolidation, dead code reduction, guardrails), measurable improvements, and remaining strategic risks.

## 2. Objectives & Success Criteria

| Objective | Result | Evidence Reference |
|-----------|--------|--------------------|
| Reduce duplication (SSE logic) | TBD | `sse_shared.py` diff, tests pass |
| Consolidate metrics & env docs | TBD | `METRICS.md`, `ENVIRONMENT.md`, stubs |
| Introduce CI non-regression gates | TBD | `validate_cleanup.py` logs |
| Remove/Archive legacy & temp scripts | TBD | Inventory delta table |
| Stabilize flakey tests | TBD | Flake tracker (future) / rerun stats |

Brief discussion aligning achievements to original goals (see `clean.md`).

## 3. Scope & Waves Executed

| Wave | Description | Status | Key Artifacts |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| A | Safe archival (temp/debug/static) | Complete | CHANGELOG, archive list |
| B | SSE shared extraction (Ph1/Ph2) | Complete | `sse_shared.py`, related tests |
| C | Docs & governance consolidation | In progress | `SSE.md`, stubs, `GOVERNANCE.md` |

Deferred / Not In Scope items list (if any) with rationale.

## 4. Inventory & Footprint Delta

Insert automated table (script placeholder) summarizing before vs after counts:

| Category | Before | After | Delta | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Python Modules | TBD | TBD | TBD | |
| Scripts (active) | TBD | TBD | TBD | |
| Archived / Removed | TBD | TBD | +TBD | |
| Markdown Docs (canonical) | TBD | TBD | TBD | Dup consolidation |
| Stub Docs | TBD | TBD | +TBD | Pending removal window |
| Test Files | TBD | TBD | TBD | Orphans removed? |

## 5. Quality Gates & Baselines

| Gate | Baseline | Current | Drift | Pass? | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| Coverage (%) | <baseline.json> | TBD | TBD | Y/N | Floor & drop thresholds |
| Dead Code (count) | 0 (budget) | TBD | TBD | Y/N | High-confidence only |
| Orphan Tests | 0 | TBD | TBD | Y/N | Heuristic |
| Env Missing Vars | 0 | TBD | TBD | Y/N | Strict missing |
| Docs Index Missing | 0 | TBD | TBD | Y/N | Required set |

Add sample snippet from a successful validation run.

## 6. Refactor Details (SSE Example)

Summarize Phase 1 & 2 extraction: pre vs post responsibilities, risk mitigation (tests, benchmarks), and measurable benefits (maintenance reduction, single security surface).

## 7. Metrics & Observability Enhancements

List additions or rationalizations (catalog generation, removal of duplicate metric docs, SSE advanced metrics). Note any metrics slated for future gating (latency p95).

## 8. Risk Register

| Risk | Category | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|----------|------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Stub removal drift | Docs | Medium | Low | Watchlist in `GOVERNANCE.md` | Docs owner |
| Coverage erosion | Quality | Low | Medium | Gate + baseline updates | Core Eng |
| Latency regression (SSE) | Performance | Medium | Medium | Future gate | Streaming |
| Cardinality explosion (metrics) | Observability | Medium | High | Group gating + audit | Observability |

## 9. Remaining Work / Follow-ups

Bullet list referencing open issues / next phase tasks (flake tracker, latency gate, SBOM tooling, final stub removals).

## 10. Recommendations

Prioritized recommendations (short list) for continued governance maturity.

## 11. Appendices

A. CHANGELOG excerpts
B. Inventory raw JSON digest
C. Dead code scan sample output
D. Coverage baseline file contents

Maintenance: Keep this report updated until all follow-ups closed, then snapshot and link from `README.md`.
