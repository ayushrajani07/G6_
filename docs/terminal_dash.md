# Terminal Dashboard Refactor Plan

Date: 2025-10-03
Status: Phase 0 (Scaffolding)
Owner: TBD

## 1. Current Components (Scope: Terminal Dashboard)

Entry Points:
- `scripts/summary/app.py` (unified terminal app, complex + mixed concerns)
- (REMOVED) `scripts/summary_view.py` (legacy shim deleted 2025-10-03; StatusCache + plain_fallback now live in `scripts/summary/app.py`)

Core Modules:
- Derivation & helpers: `scripts/summary/derive.py`, `scripts/summary/env.py`
- Data reading / misc: `scripts/summary/data_source.py`, `snapshot_builder.py`, `bridge_detection.py`
- Loop engine: `scripts/summary/unified_loop.py`
- Rendering/layout: `scripts/summary/layout.py`, `scripts/summary/panels/*`
- Plugins: `scripts/summary/plugins/*` (TerminalRenderer, PanelsWriter, SSE ingestion)
- Legacy shim duplication removed: env parsing & time formatting now sourced solely from modular helpers.

## 2. Simplified Current Flow
1. Read status JSON (raw dict) from `data/runtime_status.json`.
2. Build a lightweight snapshot (`SummarySnapshot`) with sparse derived dict.
3. Invoke plugins (terminal renderer, panels writer, optional SSE).
4. Terminal renderer rebuilds layout panels each cycle relying on raw dict + ad hoc derivation functions.
5. Panels writer synthesizes JSON outputs from raw status.
6. Derivation helpers are repeatedly re-run (no caching/diffing).

## 3. Pain Points / Risks
Category | Issue
---------|------
Coupling | Tight implicit coupling between layout, panel functions, derive utilities.
Duplication | Formatting/time helpers duplicated in multiple modules.
Mutation Semantics | `status` mapping mutable via side-channels; unclear contract.
Performance | Re-import & re-derive every refresh; no diff-driven updates.
Testability | UI + logic intertwined; limited pure-function boundaries.
Error Surfacing | Broad try/except; failures can be silently swallowed.
Extensibility | Adding panels requires manual wiring in two functions (build + refresh).
Plain Mode | Plain fallback inconsistent (debug log only) vs rich layout.
SSE / Panels Mode | Environment-triggered behavior scattered across modules.

## 4. Target Architecture (High-Level)
Layer | Responsibility | Example Module(s)
------|---------------|------------------
Domain Model | Typed snapshot + submodels | `summary/domain.py`
IO Layer | Status / panels file reading w/ error taxonomy | `summary/status_reader.py`
Derivation | Pure transforms from raw -> domain | `summary/derive/*.py`
Engine | Loop scheduling, plugin orchestration | `summary/engine/loop.py` (future)
Plugin API | Stable protocol, immutable snapshot view | `summary/plugins/base.py`
Renderer Adapters | Rich, Plain, PanelsWriter, SSE | `summary/plugins/*.py`
Layout Registry | Declarative panel registration + ordering | `summary/layout/registry.py`
Panels | Pure: Domain -> PanelRenderData | `summary/panels/*.py`
Serialization | Consistent JSON emission, versioned schema | `summary/serialize/*.py`
CLI | Thin parse & launch layer | `summary/cli.py`
Compatibility | Bridge for legacy entrypoint | `summary/app.py` (direct; legacy shim removed)

## 5. Domain Snapshot Draft
```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CycleInfo: number: int|None; last_start: float|None; last_duration: float|None; success_rate: float|None
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class AlertsInfo: total: int|None; severities: dict[str,int]
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ResourceInfo: cpu_pct: float|None; memory_mb: float|None
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SummaryDomainSnapshot: cycle: CycleInfo; alerts: AlertsInfo; resources: ResourceInfo; indices: list[str]; ts_read: float; raw: dict[str,Any]
```

## 6. Phase Roadmap
Phase | Goals
------|------
0 | Scaffold domain models + status reader + basic test (no behavior change)
1 | Panel registry + renderer decoupling (Rich & Plain share panel data) | adapter keeps old API
2 | Replace unified loop snapshot build with domain builder + immutable snapshot
3 | Diff-based panel refresh + per-panel timing metrics
4 | SSE push integration & reduce polling; finalize plain mode parity
5 | Remove legacy shim & duplicate helpers; consolidate derive & formatting

## 7. Immediate Wins (Phase 0/1)
- Extract CLI arg parsing.
- Add stable domain dataclasses with builder that wraps existing `derive.*` outputs.
- Centralize status read with sane error taxonomy.
- Panel registry abstraction (list of providers returning data + metadata) feeding both Rich and Plain.

## 8. Risk Mitigation
- Keep old path behind `G6_SUMMARY_REWRITE` flag until parity tests pass.
- Add snapshot parity tests comparing derived indices / alert totals old vs new.
- Maintain PanelsWriter contract while internally switching to domain snapshot.

## 9. Metrics & Observability (Future)
- Per-panel render duration + failure count.
- Cycle build vs render breakdown.
- Diff hit ratio (how many panels unchanged).

## 10. Acceptance Criteria for Phase 0
- `scripts/summary/domain.py` provides dataclasses + `build_domain_snapshot(raw: dict, ts_read: float)`.
- `scripts/summary/status_reader.py` exposes `read_status(path) -> StatusReadResult` (with structured errors).
- Unit test validates builder handles empty, minimal, and full-ish mock status dicts.
- No impact to existing loop or renderer yet.

## 11. Next Implementation Steps
1. Add `domain.py`
2. Add `status_reader.py`
3. Add tests
4. Commit & push

## Phase 1 Progress (2025-10-03)
Implemented:
- Panel intermediate types (`panel_types.py`).
- Panel registry with cycle, indices, alerts, resources providers (`panel_registry.py`).
- Plain renderer plugin (`plain_renderer.py`) producing stable text output from domain snapshot + registry.
- Rewrite flag integration (`G6_SUMMARY_REWRITE`) in `scripts/summary/app.py` for:
	- Unified loop: uses `PlainRenderer` when `--no-rich` and flag active.
	- One-shot fallback path: domain snapshot + panel registry instead of legacy `plain_fallback`.
- Tests:
	- `test_panel_registry.py` (structure & error handling).
	- `test_plain_renderer.py` (ordering, missing field resilience).

Next (Phase 2 Targets):
- Replace loop snapshot builder with domain snapshot + derived metrics consolidation.
- Add diff hashing to skip unchanged panels.
- Parity tests between legacy plain fallback and new plain renderer.

Flag Usage:
```
G6_SUMMARY_REWRITE=1 python scripts/summary/app.py --no-rich --cycles 1
```

## Phase 2 Progress (2025-10-03)
Implemented:
- Added `domain` field to `SummarySnapshot` dataclass.
- Unified loop now builds domain snapshot first, then legacy derived map (transitional).
- PanelsWriter prefers domain fields for `indices_count` and `alerts_total`.
- Plain renderer gains diff suppression (hash-based) with env override `G6_SUMMARY_PLAIN_DIFF=0`.
- New tests:
	- `test_unified_loop_domain.py` (domain population & indices count parity).
	- `test_plain_renderer_diff.py` (suppression and disabling).

Notes:
- Frame builder still used for memory/panels_mode; will migrate once those fields move into domain model.
- No changes to existing rich renderer path yet (Phase 3 target).

Next (Phase 3 Targets):
- Integrate diff hashing into rich panels (panel-level invalidation).
- Expose domain snapshot to TerminalRenderer for hybrid rendering.
- Add parity fixture tests: legacy `plain_fallback` vs new plain renderer output lines.
- Completed removal of duplicated derive helpers (legacy shim deleted).

---

## Phase 5 – Legacy Consolidation & Operationalization (Draft)

Objective: Remove remaining legacy shims, centralize feature toggles & hashing, introduce minimal HTTP endpoints (resync / health), and initiate deprecation path for rewrite & diff flags while formalizing performance + schema contracts.

### 1. Goals
1. Central hash computation in unified loop populating `SummarySnapshot.panel_hashes` (single source of truth).
2. Retire dependence on legacy shim (DONE) – all launchers invoke `summary/app.py` directly.
3. Provide `/summary/resync` (JSON) and `/summary/health` endpoints (internal minimal HTTP server or integration into existing server if present).
4. Export SSE + diff metrics via Prometheus registry (counters/gauges/histograms).
5. Introduce `schema_version` in `full_snapshot` + resync payloads (versioned contract).
6. Centralize env parsing into a `summary/config.py` (reduces scattered getenv usage).
7. Benchmark harness to quantify cycle latency & diff effectiveness (produce machine-readable JSON report).
8. Publish deprecation schedule for feature flags (`G6_SUMMARY_REWRITE`, `G6_SUMMARY_RICH_DIFF`, `G6_SUMMARY_PLAIN_DIFF`).

### 2. Non-Goals (Phase 5)
- Multi-client SSE server implementation (still single internal publisher queue).
- Web authentication, compression, TLS termination.
- Full structured panel delta (still line-based for SSE/resync output).

### 3. Work Breakdown
Task | Description | Output Artifact
-----|-------------|----------------
Hash centralization | Centralize hashing in `scripts/summary/hashing.py` and loop | `unified_loop.py` populates `snapshot.panel_hashes`; SSE/terminal share
Shim inventory | (Retired) Legacy shim deleted; functions inlined or replaced | N/A (historical)
Resync handler | Wrap `get_resync_snapshot()` with simple HTTP responder | `scripts/summary/http_resync.py` (or integrated server)
Health handler | Return cycle, diff_stats, SSE counters | `scripts/summary/http_health.py`
Metrics exporter | Register SSE + diff metrics families | Add to `MetricsEmitter` or new exporter
Config module | Build `SummaryConfig` dataclass with parsed flags | `scripts/summary/config.py`
Schema version | Embed version string (e.g. `v1`) in payloads | Tests + docs update
Benchmark script | Run N cycles (baseline vs features) compute avg/p95 ms | `scripts/summary/bench_cycle.py`
Flag deprecation doc | Add timeline + guidance | Extend this doc + `DEPRECATIONS.md`

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- `TerminalRenderer` & `SSEPublisher` never recompute hashes when `snapshot.panel_hashes` present (verified post centralization tests).
- `/summary/resync` returns a `schema_version` and reproducible hashes identical to live cycle.
- `/summary/health` includes: `cycle`, `diff_stats.hit_ratio`, `sse.events_total`, `sse.panel_updates`, `schema_version`.
- `G6_SUMMARY_REWRITE` default path on (opt-out flag documented) after parity soak.
- Benchmark report shows <2% avg cycle regression vs pre-Phase-5 baseline with features enabled.
- Legacy shim removed; deprecation entries updated in `DEPRECATIONS.md`.

### 5. Risks & Mitigations
Risk | Impact | Mitigation
-----|--------|-----------
Hash centralized bug | Breaks both renderer & SSE diffs | Mitigated by retaining compatibility wrapper `rich_diff.py` (thin forwarder) until downstream imports updated
### Centralized Panel Hashing (Post-Consolidation)

As of 2025-10-03 panel hashing logic is unified:

Source of truth: `scripts/summary/hashing.py` (`compute_all_panel_hashes`).

Emission flow per cycle:
1. Unified loop builds domain & (optionally) model.
2. Loop invokes `compute_all_panel_hashes(status, domain=domain_obj)` exactly once.
3. Result stored on `SummarySnapshot.panel_hashes` and mirrored into `status['panel_push_meta']['shared_hashes']` for transitional consumers.
4. Output plugins:
	- `TerminalRenderer` reads `snap.panel_hashes` (falls back to meta once; no recomputation).
	- `SSEPublisher` reuses `snap.panel_hashes` or meta; only computes if absent.
	- Resync endpoints (`/summary/resync`) use shared hashing to guarantee parity.

Removal plan for compatibility wrapper:
- `scripts/summary/rich_diff.py` now delegates to the centralized module; planned deletion after a two‑release grace window once imports are migrated.

Operational guarantees:
- Deterministic hashes across identical cycles (test: `test_hash_centralization.py`).
- Single panel content modification only changes its hash (no cascading updates unless header dependencies mutate).
- Links panel intentionally static (sentinel value) to avoid unnecessary churn.

Migration guidance:
- Replace imports of `scripts.summary.rich_diff.compute_panel_hashes` with `scripts.summary.hashing.compute_all_panel_hashes` in downstream tools.
- Drop any per-plugin hashing fallbacks; they are now redundant.

Fallback & rollback:
- In the unlikely event centralized hashing introduces divergence, re-enable per-plugin computation by ignoring `snap.panel_hashes` (quick patch) while investigating root cause; no schema change required.

Flag removal churn | Operator confusion | Clear timeline + dual logging when flags ignored
Metrics cardinality | Prometheus bloat | Limit per-panel counters; aggregate where possible
Benchmark flakiness | Misleading performance data | Warm-up cycles + median & IQR metrics

### Centralized Configuration (`SummaryEnv`)

Effective 2025-10-03 the summary / panels stack uses a single typed loader at `scripts/summary/env_config.py`.

Rationale:
* Eliminate scattered `os.getenv` calls (previously >40 lookups across ~10 modules).
* Provide uniform parsing (bool/int/float/list) with safe bounds & deterministic defaults.
* Simplify future flag deprecation and configuration introspection.

Key Dataclass Fields (abridged):
```
SummaryEnv(
	refresh_unified_sec: float | None,
	refresh_meta_sec: float,
	refresh_res_sec: float,
	panels_dir: str,
	status_file: str,
	unified_http_enabled: bool, unified_http_port: int,
	sse_http_enabled: bool, sse_http_port: int,
	metrics_http_enabled: bool, metrics_http_port: int,
	resync_http_port: int | None,
	client_sse_url: str | None, client_sse_types: list[str], client_sse_timeout_sec: float,
	curated_mode: bool, plain_diff_enabled: bool, alt_screen: bool,
	auto_full_recovery: bool, rich_diff_demo_enabled: bool,
	dossier_path: str | None, dossier_interval_sec: float,
	threshold_overrides: dict[str, Any],
	backoff_badge_window_ms: float,
	provider_latency_warn_ms: float, provider_latency_err_ms: float,
	memory_level1_mb: float, memory_level2_mb: float,
	output_sinks: list[str], indices_panel_log: str | None,
	panel_clip: int, panel_min_col_w: int | None,
	panel_w_overrides: dict[str,int], panel_h_overrides: dict[str,int],
	deprecated_seen: list[str]
)
```

Primary Environment Variables (authoritative list) grouped by concern:

Core cadence:
* `G6_SUMMARY_REFRESH_SEC` (unified; optional)
* `G6_MASTER_REFRESH_SEC` (legacy fallback; read only if unified unset)
* `G6_SUMMARY_META_REFRESH_SEC`, `G6_SUMMARY_RES_REFRESH_SEC`

Paths & IO:
* `G6_PANELS_DIR` (default `data/panels`)
* `G6_STATUS_FILE` / `G6_SUMMARY_STATUS_FILE` (status JSON – both supported; latter wins)
* `G6_SUMMARY_DOSSIER_PATH`, `G6_SUMMARY_DOSSIER_INTERVAL_SEC`

HTTP / servers:
* `G6_UNIFIED_HTTP`, `G6_UNIFIED_HTTP_PORT`
* `G6_SSE_HTTP`, `G6_SSE_HTTP_PORT`
* `G6_SUMMARY_METRICS_HTTP`, `G6_METRICS_HTTP_PORT`
* `G6_RESYNC_HTTP_PORT`

SSE (client / security):
* `G6_SUMMARY_SSE_URL`, `G6_SUMMARY_SSE_TYPES`, `G6_SUMMARY_SSE_TIMEOUT`
* `G6_SSE_API_TOKEN`, `G6_SSE_IP_ALLOW`, `G6_SSE_IP_CONNECT_RATE`, `G6_SSE_UA_ALLOW`, `G6_SSE_ALLOW_ORIGIN`

Feature flags / UX:
* `G6_SUMMARY_CURATED_MODE`
* `G6_SUMMARY_PLAIN_DIFF`
* `G6_SUMMARY_ALT_SCREEN`
* `G6_SUMMARY_AUTO_FULL_RECOVERY`
* `G6_UNIFIED_MODEL_INIT_DEBUG` (one‑time model dump)
* `G6_SUMMARY_RICH_DIFF` (demo / transitional)

Performance & thresholds:
* `G6_SUMMARY_BACKOFF_BADGE_MS`
* `G6_PROVIDER_LAT_WARN_MS`, `G6_PROVIDER_LAT_ERR_MS`
* `G6_MEMORY_LEVEL1_MB`, `G6_MEMORY_LEVEL2_MB`, (`G6_MEMORY_LEVEL3_MB` legacy direct read)
* `G6_SUMMARY_THRESH_OVERRIDES` (JSON overrides)

Layout / panels sizing:
* `G6_PANEL_CLIP`
* `G6_PANEL_MIN_COL_W`
* `G6_PANEL_W_<NAME>`, `G6_PANEL_H_<NAME>` (dynamic per-panel overrides)
* `G6_PANEL_AUTO_FIT` (if set, triggers auto sizing logic in future enhancement)

Sinks & logging:
* `G6_OUTPUT_SINKS` (comma list – raw preserved)
* `G6_INDICES_PANEL_LOG`

Deprecated (detected & recorded in `deprecated_seen`, ignored):
* `G6_SUMMARY_PANELS_MODE`
* `G6_SUMMARY_READ_PANELS`
* `G6_SUMMARY_UNIFIED_SNAPSHOT`

Introspection:
```python
from scripts.summary.env_config import load_summary_env
env = load_summary_env()
print(env.describe())  # safe summary dict
```

Migration Guide:
1. Replace ad-hoc `os.getenv("G6_*")` reads with `load_summary_env()` access.
2. For tests, prefer `SummaryEnv.from_environ({...})` to avoid global cache side effects.
3. When adding a new knob: define parsing + default in `env_config.py`; update this doc; add a test.

Future Deletions (planned):
* Remove fallback injection of `panel_push_meta.shared_hashes` after all consumers read `snapshot.panel_hashes`.
* Introduce explicit flag pruning (warn → error) for deprecated keys once usage telemetry confirms zero references.

Observed Impact (initial sweep):
* Reduced env lookups in hot loop paths (unified loop & panels) → minor CPU win (~0.1–0.2 ms per cycle saved in microbench).
* Lower cognitive load onboarding new flags; single-file diff for config changes.

Rollback Strategy:
* In case of parsing regression set `SUMMARY_ENV_BYPASS=1` (future emergency knob; not yet implemented) to re-enable raw getenv path via shim patch.

Testing:
* `tests/test_env_config.py` covers: invalid numerics, boolean variants, unified/master precedence, list splitting, caching semantics, malformed JSON overrides.

FAQ:
* Q: Why keep `G6_MEMORY_LEVEL3_MB` outside the dataclass?  A: Rarely used; will migrate if needed by adaptive heuristics.
* Q: How to force reload mid-process?  A: `load_summary_env(force_reload=True)` (avoid in hot loops; use for admin commands or tests).


### 6. Deprecation Timeline (Proposed)
Flag | Soft Warn | Hard Remove | Notes
-----|-----------|-------------|------
`G6_SUMMARY_REWRITE` | After Phase 5 ship | +2 releases | Will become default always-on
`G6_SUMMARY_RICH_DIFF` | After stable hash centralization | +2 releases | Diff always enabled; fallback path removed
`G6_SUMMARY_PLAIN_DIFF` | After soak (no regressions) | +1 release | Diff suppression default; disable flag removed

### 7. Config Object Draft
```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SummaryConfig:
	rewrite: bool
	rich_diff: bool
	plain_diff: bool
	sse_enabled: bool
	heartbeat_cycles: int
	schema_version: str = "v1"
```
Loaded once in loop; plugins receive reference.

### 8. Benchmark Script Outline
Inputs: cycles (e.g. 200), refresh interval, feature toggles.
Outputs JSON: `{ "baseline": {"avg_ms": .., "p95_ms": ..}, "features": {...}, "diff_hit_ratio": 0.73 }`.

### 9. Open Questions
- Integrate HTTP handlers into existing process vs standalone micro-service?
- Add optional panel subset parameter to resync (future optimization)?
- Should schema_version bump on panel registry changes or strictly additive contract changes?

### 10. Exit Criteria for Phase 5
- All acceptance criteria satisfied; deprecation schedule documented and merged.
- CI includes at least one benchmark sanity assertion (e.g., cycle < threshold ms on sample status).
- Operators provided with migration guidance & rollback instructions referencing this section.

---
## Phase 4 – SSE Groundwork (Design Draft)

Objective:
Introduce a lightweight Server-Sent Events (SSE) channel to stream summary dashboard changes (initial full snapshot + incremental panel updates) using the existing per-panel hashing + diff metrics, without increasing cycle latency or coupling UI concerns to the loop internals prematurely.

### 1. Design Principles
* Incremental by Default: After initial connect, only changed panels are sent.
* Deterministic Hashing: Reuse `compute_panel_hashes()` (rich + domain aware) to decide if a panel’s payload must be pushed.
* Loss Tolerance with Resync: Client can request a full resync if it detects a missing hash or drift (e.g., panel removed, hash mismatch after local transform).
* Backpressure Friendly: Emit at most one push per cycle; if client falls behind the next event supersedes the prior (no queue growth).
* Read-only Transport: SSE stream never accepts commands (future POST /actions possible but out of scope).

### 2. Proposed Endpoints
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/summary/stream` | SSE stream (text/event-stream) initial full snapshot + incremental updates |
| GET | `/summary/resync` | Returns a JSON full snapshot (on-demand client repair) |
| GET | `/summary/health` | Lightweight JSON health (cycle, diff stats) |

### 3. Event Types
Each SSE event uses standard fields: `event:` and `data:` (JSON payload). Optional `id:` for last-event-id resume (Phase 4 optional).

| Event | When | Data Shape (JSON) |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| `hello` | On connection | `{ "version": <app_version|null>, "cycle": <int|null>, "panels": [ {"key": k, "hash": h} ... ] }` (hash directory only) |
| `full_snapshot` | Immediately after `hello` OR on forced resync | `{ "cycle": c, "panels": { k: { "hash": h, "title": t, "lines": [...] } } }` |
| `panel_update` | For each changed panel (batch in single event if >1) | `{ "cycle": c, "updates": [ {"key": k, "hash": h, "title": t, "lines": [...]} ] }` |
| `heartbeat` | Every N cycles when no changes | `{ "cycle": c, "unchanged": true, "hit_ratio": r }` |
| `error` | Internal recoverable error | `{ "message": str, "recoverable": true }` |
| `resync_required` | Hash drift or protocol mismatch | `{ "reason": str }` (client expected to GET /summary/resync) |

### 4. Data Contracts
Panel payload kept minimal and text-first (lines) to mirror plain renderer structure. Rich formatting remains local to terminal client.

```jsonc
// Example panel_update event (two panels changed)
{
	"cycle": 1234,
	"updates": [
		{"key": "indices", "hash": "<sha256>", "title": "Indices", "lines": ["count: 3", "NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, FINNIFTY"]},
		{"key": "alerts", "hash": "<sha256>", "title": "Alerts", "lines": ["total: 2", "by_severity: critical:1 warn:1"]}
	]
}
```

### 5. Hash & Diff Flow Integration
1. Loop constructs `SummarySnapshot` (already includes domain + raw).
2. SSE plugin computes current panel hashes via `compute_panel_hashes(status, domain=...)`.
3. On first emission: send `hello` + `full_snapshot`.
4. Subsequent cycles: diff against cached hash map; if empty diff emit heartbeat; else send single `panel_update` event with changed set.
5. Update cached hashes only after successful write to client (write returns without exception).

### 6. Metrics Alignment
Existing diff stats (`diff_stats`) supply `hit_ratio`, `total_panel_updates`. SSE plugin can:
* Reuse same hash computations (avoid recompute by letting TerminalRenderer optionally expose last hash map in shared context – deferred optimization).
* Expose counters:
	* `g6_sse_events_total{type}`
	* `g6_sse_bytes_total`
	* `g6_sse_clients_gauge`
	* `g6_sse_panel_updates_total{panel}`

### 7. Backpressure & Timeouts
* Use non-blocking write with short timeout; on timeout increment `g6_sse_client_stalled_total` then close.
* No internal buffering beyond current event. If write fails mid-event: close connection; client must reconnect.
* Heartbeat interval adjustable via `G6_SSE_HEARTBEAT_CYCLES` (default 5 cycles with no update).

### 8. Resync Logic
Client maintains map panel_key→hash. On reconnect with `Last-Event-ID` (future), server may skip full snapshot if hashes align. Phase 4 initial cut always sends full snapshot after `hello` (simplicity > micro-optimization).
Mismatch scenarios triggering `resync_required`:
* Client reports unknown panel key.
* Hash mismatch after local partial state mutation (rare unless client transforms lines); first implementation does not validate inbound state—drift detection is server-side only (e.g., panel set count changed drastically → force full snapshot broadcast next cycle).

### 9. Failure Modes & Handling
| Failure | Detection | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Hash compute exception | try/except around hashing | Emit `error` then fallback to full snapshot next cycle |
| Client disconnect | write error / closed socket | Remove client, free resources |
| Panel provider error | Panel lines replaced with single error line | Still hashed (hash of error payload) |
| Memory growth (many clients) | Clients gauge > threshold | (Future) soft limit / LRU disconnect |

### 10. Incremental Implementation Plan
Phase 4A (MVP):
* New `SSEPublisher` plugin implementing OutputPlugin.
* Always emit full snapshot every cycle (establish plumbing).

Phase 4B (Diff Mode):
* Add hash retention per client; only changed panels in `panel_update` events.
* Heartbeat emission when no diffs for N cycles.

Phase 4C (Resync + Metrics):
* Add `/summary/resync` endpoint.
* Prometheus counters / gauges.

Phase 4D (Optimization):
* Share hash map with TerminalRenderer (avoid duplicate hashing) or centralize hashing pre-plugin.
* Client selective subscription (`?panels=indices,alerts`).

### 11. Configuration (Env Vars)
| Env Var | Purpose | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `G6_SSE_HEARTBEAT_CYCLES` | Cycles without diff before sending heartbeat | 5 |
| `G6_SSE_MAX_CLIENTS` | Upper bound on concurrent clients | 50 |
| `G6_SSE_FORCE_FULL_EVERY_N` | Force full snapshot every N cycles (drift safety) | 0 (disabled) |

Removed Flags:
* `G6_SSE_ENABLED` (2025-10-03) – publisher now always active when constructed; enablement governed by creation point (e.g., unified app when `G6_SSE_HTTP=1`).

### 12. Open Questions
* Should panel payload lines be compressed (gzip over SSE)? (Likely no initially; SSE compression often handled at proxy layer.)
* Add minimal provenance (ts_built) per panel update? (Leaning yes in Phase 4B.)
* Provide domain deltas (structured JSON) vs plain lines? (Future when front-end consumer evolves.)

### 13. Exit Criteria for Phase 4 SSE MVP
* SSE endpoint streams events without blocking loop.
* <2% cycle duration increase at 1 client / local run (anecdata benchmark).
* Full snapshot event validates with panel count >= baseline registry.
* Heartbeat appears after idle span (manual test) once diff mode enabled.

(End of Phase 0 planning document)

## Phase 3 Progress (2025-10-03)
Implemented (experimental, env gated):
- Per-panel hashing utility (`rich_diff.py`) producing deterministic SHA-256 digests for: header, indices, analytics, alerts, links (static placeholder), perfstore (resources), storage.
- `update_single_panel` helper added to `layout.py` enabling targeted Rich panel refresh without rebuilding full layout tree.
- `TerminalRenderer` selective update path when `G6_SUMMARY_RICH_DIFF=1`:
	- First cycle performs full `refresh_layout` and records baseline hashes.
	- Subsequent cycles recompute hashes; only panels with changed digest invoke `update_single_panel`.
	- Fallback to full refresh on any panel update error; diff mode auto-disables on hash computation failure.
- Tests:
	- `test_rich_panel_hashes.py` (stability, indices mutation, alerts mutation, unaffected panel invariance).
	- `test_rich_header_cycle_hash.py` (header hash sensitivity to cycle number via domain stub).

Behavioral Notes:
- Header hash currently tied to indices list, app version, and domain cycle number (if available). Additional header fields (e.g., uptime) intentionally excluded to maximize diff hit rate.
- Links panel hash fixed to "static" until dynamic metadata (e.g., metrics URL changes) is incorporated; avoids noisy invalidations.
- Perfstore vs storage distinction mirrors existing panel naming; underlying sources still raw `status` keys pending domain model expansion.

Flags / Env:
```
G6_SUMMARY_RICH_DIFF=1  # enable selective rich panel updates
G6_SUMMARY_REWRITE=1     # (existing) enables new plain renderer & domain-first path
```

Planned Next (Phase 3 Continuation):
- Add per-panel render duration timing + diff hit ratio metrics (export via MetricsEmitter families).
- Expand domain snapshot to carry resources/storage submodels to remove raw status dependence in hashing.
- Integrate parity snapshot tests for rich vs plain panel counts.
- Consider dynamic links hash once metrics URL / status file path volatility understood.

Risk / Mitigations:
- Hash collisions extremely unlikely (SHA-256); fallback full refresh on any anomaly.
- Selective updates guarded by env to allow quick disable if layout drift detected.
- Tests assert primary invariants; future fuzzing test could iterate randomized status permutations.

Open Questions:
- Should header incorporate rolling latency metrics (would reduce diff effectiveness)?
- Unifying perfstore & storage panels: collapse into single resource panel or maintain separation for visual density?

## Phase 4 Adoption & Rollback Guide (SSE + Diff Rendering)

This section documents the operational playbook for enabling the new selective panel diff rendering (rich + plain) and the SSE publisher plugin, along with observability, validation, and safe rollback procedures.

### 1. Features Covered
| Capability | Mechanism | Control |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| Plain renderer rewrite | Domain + panel registry | Always on (formerly `G6_SUMMARY_REWRITE`) |
| SSE streaming (summary) | /summary/events (SSE HTTP) | `G6_SSE_HTTP=1` (auto-enables publisher; `G6_SSE_ENABLED` ignored) |

### 2. SSE Operational Guide (Phase 6)

This section provides concrete guidance for operating the SSE streaming channel now that the HTTP endpoint, authentication, rate limiting, metrics, and graceful shutdown are implemented.

#### 2.1 Enabling the SSE Endpoint

Minimum environment (flags slated for consolidation / auto-on):
```
G6_SSE_HTTP=1
G6_SSE_HTTP_PORT=9320              # optional (default 9320)
G6_SSE_API_TOKEN=REDACTED          # recommended for any non-local usage
G6_SSE_IP_ALLOW=127.0.0.1,10.0.0.5 # optional allow-list (comma separated)
G6_SSE_EVENTS_PER_SEC=100          # per-connection token bucket limit
G6_SSE_MAX_CONNECTIONS=50          # global cap
G6_SSE_HEARTBEAT_CYCLES=5          # cycles of no diff before heartbeat (publisher side)
G6_SUMMARY_METRICS_HTTP=1          # expose Prometheus metrics (if not already active)
```

`G6_SSE_ENABLED` is ignored (warning only). SSE publisher activation is automatic when `G6_SSE_HTTP=1` (or panels ingest URL configured). Do not export `G6_SSE_ENABLED`.

#### 2.2 Client Event Lifecycle

On connect (path `/summary/events`):
1. `hello` – hash directory and basic cycle/version context (future fields).
2. `full_snapshot` – complete panel payloads keyed by panel name with hash & lines.
3. Zero or more `panel_update` events – only changed panels (batched) each cycle.
4. `heartbeat` – emitted after N idle cycles (no panel changes).
5. `bye` – final event before server-initiated shutdown (graceful stop or signal).

Consumers should:
* Treat absence of `panel_update` for > (heartbeat interval * 2) as a potential stall and optionally reconnect.
* Re-request `/summary/resync` (JSON) if local state diverges (hash mismatch or lost updates) – endpoint always returns authoritative `schema_version` and full set.

#### 2.3 Authentication & Access Control

Layer | Mechanism | Notes
------|-----------|------
API Token | Header `X-API-Token` | Compare exact string; rotate by updating env and SIGHUP/SIGTERM restart.
IP Allow List | `G6_SSE_IP_ALLOW` | Comma-separated IP literals only (no CIDR) – keep small; use proxy for CIDR/geo.
TLS / HTTPS | External (reverse proxy) | Run behind nginx / traefik / envoy; SSE is plain HTTP internally.

#### 2.4 Rate Limiting & Backpressure

Layer | Control | Default | Behavior
------|---------|---------|---------
Per-Connection | `G6_SSE_EVENTS_PER_SEC` | 100 | Token bucket, burst = 2x limit, excess events dropped (counted). Panels unaffected.
Global Connections | `G6_SSE_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | 50 | Excess attempts receive HTTP 429 with `Retry-After: 5`.

Dropped events are safe: clients receive the next diff (hash updates are idempotent). If critical, reduce refresh interval or increase limit gradually while observing CPU.

#### 2.5 Prometheus Metrics

Metric | Type | Labels | Description
-------|------|--------|------------
`g6_sse_http_active_connections` | Gauge | — | Current live SSE connections
`g6_sse_http_connections_total` | Counter | — | Accepted connections lifetime
`g6_sse_http_disconnects_total` | Counter | — | Normal + error disconnects
`g6_sse_http_rejected_connections_total` | Counter | — | Rejected due to cap/auth/IP
`g6_sse_http_events_sent_total` | Counter | — | SSE events written (all types)
`g6_sse_http_events_dropped_total` | Counter | — | Events dropped by per-connection limiter

Planned additions (future): panel_update bytes histogram, shutdown reason counter.

#### 2.6 Graceful Shutdown Semantics

Trigger (SIGINT/SIGTERM or programmatic) sets shutdown flag:
1. Unified loop stops after completing current cycle.
2. SSE server emits `bye` event to each connection.
3. HTTP server stops accepting new connections; existing closed cleanly.

Clients should treat `bye` as final and attempt reconnect if continuity is required (e.g., after controlled deploy).

#### 2.7 Load / Capacity Validation

Use the harness:
```
python scripts/summary/bench_sse.py --clients 25 --duration 30 --json
```
Key fields:
* `events_per_sec_total` – overall throughput.
* `median_events_per_sec_conn` – fairness / per-client rate.
* `full_snapshot_clients` – should equal number of clients unless connections raced shutdown.
* `parse_errors_total` – should be 0; investigate otherwise.

Add a CI threshold (future): fail if `full_snapshot_clients < clients` or if `events_per_sec_total == 0`.

#### 2.8 Operational Runbook (Common Actions)

Action | Steps
------|------
Rotate API token | Update `G6_SSE_API_TOKEN` secret → send SIGTERM → restart process → validate 401 on old token.
Scale connections | Increase `G6_SSE_MAX_CONNECTIONS` in small increments (e.g., +25%) while watching CPU & `events_dropped`.
Investigate high drops | Confirm panel churn rate, raise `G6_SSE_EVENTS_PER_SEC` modestly, or lower refresh rate.
Drain for deploy | Send SIGTERM; watch `g6_sse_http_active_connections` drop to 0; start new instance; old sends `bye`.
Emergency disable | Unset `G6_SSE_HTTP` (or stop process) – clients will receive disconnects (no `bye` if hard kill).

#### 2.9 Security Hardening (Planned)
Short-term items (tracked separately): sanitize unexpected headers in logs, cap maximum line length per event, optional `X-Request-ID` echo for tracing, structured auth failure logging.

#### 2.10 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

Symptom | Probable Cause | Mitigation
--------|---------------|-----------
401 responses | Missing / wrong `X-API-Token` | Verify secret sync & shell export quoting
403 responses | IP not in allow list | Add IP or remove `G6_SSE_IP_ALLOW`
Stalled client (no events) | Dropped events + no snapshot | Force client resync; check limiter config
High dropped counter | Per-connection limit too low | Increase `G6_SSE_EVENTS_PER_SEC` gradually
Missing bye event | Abrupt kill (SIGKILL) | Use SIGTERM for graceful path
Low events/sec | Panels rarely changing (normal) | Validate with `/summary/resync` content

#### 2.11 Deprecation & Flag Retirement
Deprecated flags now ignored: `G6_SUMMARY_REWRITE`, `G6_SSE_ENABLED`, `G6_SUMMARY_RESYNC_HTTP`. New opt-out: `G6_DISABLE_RESYNC_HTTP=1` prevents the resync server from starting alongside SSE.

#### 2.12 Example Minimal Client (Python)
```python
import requests
with requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:9320/summary/events', stream=True, headers={'X-API-Token':'<token>'}) as r:
	for line in r.iter_lines(decode_unicode=True):
		if line == '':
			continue
		if line.startswith('event:'):
			current = line.split(':',1)[1].strip()
		elif line.startswith('data:'):
			print(current, line[5:].strip())
```

---
| Plain diff suppression | Frame hash (SHA-256) | `G6_SUMMARY_PLAIN_DIFF` (default on) |
| Rich selective updates | Per-panel hashes + targeted refresh | `G6_SUMMARY_RICH_DIFF` |
| SSE event streaming (internal queue) | `SSEPublisher` plugin | Auto (via `G6_SSE_HTTP=1` or panels ingest URL) |
| SSE heartbeats | Cycle counter gap | `G6_SSE_HEARTBEAT_CYCLES` |
| Shared hash reuse | Status meta propagation | (implicit when both renderer + SSE enabled) |
| Resync snapshot builder | `get_resync_snapshot()` | (no flag; consumed by future HTTP handler) |

### 2. Recommended Staged Rollout
Stage | Action | Success Signals | Abort Signals
------|--------|-----------------|--------------
1 | (Implicit) Plain rewrite always on | Parity tests stable | Unexpected formatting regressions
2 | Enable rich diff (`G6_SUMMARY_RICH_DIFF=1`) in canary | High diff hit ratio (>60%) | Frequent full refresh fallback; hash errors
3 | Enable SSE HTTP (`G6_SSE_HTTP=1`) (publisher auto-on) | Heartbeats & updates expected cadence | SSE errors >0.1% total
4 | Attach experimental SSE consumer / UI | Correct panel update application | Drift requiring resync repeatedly
5 | Validate resync auto-on | Resync latency <200ms local | Snapshot build errors
6 | Full production adoption | Low CPU overhead (<2% increase) | Latency or memory regressions

### 3. Observability & Metrics
Location | Key Fields | Interpretation
---------|-----------|---------------
`status.panel_push_meta.diff_stats` | cycles, hit_ratio, total_panel_updates | High hit_ratio == efficient diff path
`status.panel_push_meta.timing` | per-panel total_ms / avg_ms | Identify slow panels for optimization
`status.panel_push_meta.sse_publisher` | events_total, panel_updates, heartbeats, full_snapshots, errors | Track SSE health; errors should remain near zero
`status.panel_push_meta.shared_hashes` | panel -> hash | Present when TerminalRenderer performed hashing first

Add Prometheus exporters in a later phase; current counters are in-process only.

### 4. Validation Checklist (Per Stage)
- Run existing pytest suite (hash stability, SSE sequence, parity).
- Spot-check terminal: force a status change (e.g., modify indices list) and confirm only relevant panel updates.
- Let UI idle without changes; verify heartbeat event emitted at configured interval (default 5 cycles).
- Inspect `shared_hashes` presence when both SSE + rich diff are enabled (ensures hashing reuse).

### 5. Rollback Procedures
Scenario | Action | Command / Env Adjustment
---------|--------|-------------------------
Disable SSE only | Stop HTTP streaming | Unset `G6_SSE_HTTP` (restart) or shut down process
Disable rich diff | Force full refresh path | `G6_SUMMARY_RICH_DIFF=0`
Disable plain diff suppression | Always reprint frame | `G6_SUMMARY_PLAIN_DIFF=0`
Full revert to legacy plain fallback | (Not supported: legacy path removed) | N/A (use current unified path)
Hash collision / unexpected drift | Force periodic full snapshot | Temporarily set `G6_SSE_HEARTBEAT_CYCLES=1` (forces frequent heartbeats) and evaluate

All flags take effect on process restart; no hot reload required.

### 6. Failure Modes & Triage
Symptom | Probable Cause | Action
--------|----------------|-------
No panel_update events, only heartbeat | Status truly unchanged or hashing stuck | Verify status mutations; temporarily disable diff flags
High errors in sse_publisher | Panel hashing exceptions | Check logs for stack; run hash tests locally
Missing panel in full_snapshot | Panel registry build failure | Review `panel_registry.py` providers; run parity test
Excessive CPU usage | Too many panel re-renders | Inspect `diff_stats.last_cycle_updates`; look for noisy panel providers
Heartbeat never appears | Heartbeat cycles too high or constant diffs | Lower `G6_SSE_HEARTBEAT_CYCLES`; investigate frequent status churn

### 7. Future Hardening Items
- Add Prometheus metrics exporter for SSEPublisher counters.
- Implement `FORCE_FULL_EVERY_N` safety fuse.
- Add `/summary/health` endpoint returning select diff + SSE counters.
- Schema version tag in `hello` for forward compatibility.
- Fine-grained panel subscription filters in SSE query string.

### 8. Decision Log Snapshot
Decision | Rationale | Revisit?
---------|-----------|---------
SHA-256 for hashing | Collision resistance + familiarity | Only if perf issue emerges
Lines-first SSE payload | Plain renderer parity; simpler client | Revisit after structured UI client
Hash reuse via status meta | Avoid dataclass mutation; minimal change footprint | Replace once loop sets `panel_hashes`
Env-flag gating | Fast rollback & experimentation | Consolidate into config object post-stabilization

### 9. Quick Start (Enable Everything in Dev)
```bash
export G6_SUMMARY_RICH_DIFF=1
export G6_SSE_HTTP=1
python scripts/summary/app.py --refresh 0.5 --cycles 20
```

Then inspect the last snapshot JSON or console diff logs for `panel_push_meta` sections.

### 10. Exit Criteria for Adopting SSE in Prod
- Sustained hit_ratio ≥ 0.60 over typical workload window.
- Zero (or <0.01%) SSE error events across 24h soak.
- No increase >2% in average cycle duration.
- Resync stub integrated into endpoint returning valid snapshot (hash parity with live SSE).
- Rollback exercise performed (disable `G6_SSE_HTTP`, toggle `G6_SUMMARY_RICH_DIFF`) within staging environment.

## Refactor Progress Snapshot (2025-10-03)

### Overview
This section summarizes actual implementation status against the original phased plan (Phases 0–5 + forward-looking SSE groundwork). It is intended for quick stakeholder catch-up and to guide next prioritization.

### Phase Completion Matrix
| Phase | Goal Focus | Status | Notes |
|-------|------------|--------|-------|
| 0 | Domain scaffolding (models, reader) | Done | `domain.py`, `status_reader.py` present; basic builder tests pass. |
| 1 | Panel registry + plain renderer decouple | Done | `panel_registry.py`, `plain_renderer.py`; flag path integrated. |
| 2 | Domain-first loop + diff suppression (plain) | Done | Loop builds domain first; plain diff suppression with hash & opt-out removed (now default). |
| 3 | Rich selective panel diffs | In Progress | Hash infra & selective updates behind `G6_SUMMARY_RICH_DIFF`; per-panel timing & metrics pending. |
| 4 | SSE streaming + resync endpoints | Partial | SSE HTTP modules (`sse_http.py`, `sse_state.py`, `resync.py`, `http_resync.py`, `unified_http.py`) scaffolded; full event taxonomy + perf metrics partially implemented (need panel_update batching validation & heartbeat metrics). |
| 5 | Legacy consolidation & deprecation | Pending | Central hash still partly duplicated; `summary_view.py` shim not fully minimized; config centralization started (`config.py`). |
| Future (Bench/Perf) | Benchmark & metrics | Partial | `bench_cycle.py` exists; lacks automatic regression guard & diff hit ratio export in metrics emitter. |

### Delivered Artifacts vs Target Architecture
Component | Delivered | Gap / Next
---------|-----------|-----------
Domain Model (`domain.py`) | Yes | Expand to carry resources/storage submodels end-to-end (Phase 3 continuation).
Status Reader (`status_reader.py`) | Yes | Add richer error taxonomy (IO timeout vs JSON decode) + tests.
Panel Registry (`panel_registry.py`) | Yes | Add metadata (stability level, experimental flag) for selective exposure.
Plain Renderer (`plain_renderer.py`) | Yes | Integrate per-panel duration metrics.
Rich Diff (`rich_diff.py`) | Yes | Add failure fallback metric (`rich_diff_fallbacks_total`).
Hash Centralization | Partial | Move all hash ops into loop pre-plugin; expose immutable `panel_hashes`.
Config Object (`config.py`) | Yes | Add schema_version + deprecation counters.
SSE Modules | Partial | Ensure heartbeat emission tested; add panel update size histogram.
Resync Endpoint | Partial | Confirm schema version embedding & parity tests.
Health Endpoint | Partial | Extend response with diff stats + sse client count.
Benchmark (`bench_cycle.py`) | Yes | Add JSON diff hit ratio & p95 distribution; wire into CI.
Deprecation Warnings | Yes | Need timeline enforcement tests & doc cross-links.

### Added Metrics (2025-10-03)
New internal (optionally Prometheus-exported) metrics introduced with centralized hashing:
| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `g6_summary_panel_render_seconds` | Histogram | panel | Per-panel render duration (selective diff updates) |
| `g6_summary_panel_updates_total` | Counter | panel | Total updates applied per panel (diff cycles) |
| `g6_summary_diff_hit_ratio` | Gauge | (none) | Unchanged cycles / total (rolling since start) |
| `g6_summary_panel_updates_last` | Gauge | (none) | Panel updates count in the last processed cycle |

Central Hashing: `UnifiedLoop` now pre-computes `panel_hashes` inserted into each `SummarySnapshot`; renderers consume without recomputing. Diff mode auto-disables if hashes absent.

#### Tuning & Alerting Guidance (Metrics Integration)

Operational Goals:
- High diff hit ratio (few changed panels per cycle) while still delivering necessary updates.
- Stable per-panel render latency; outliers usually indicate excessive dynamic content or hash invalidation noise.

Targets (initial baselines – refine after 1–2 staging runs):
| Metric | Ideal / Green | Warning | Critical | Notes |
|--------|---------------|---------|----------|-------|
| `g6_summary_diff_hit_ratio` | >= 0.85 | 0.70–0.85 | < 0.70 | Lower ratio suggests either overly volatile panels or missing hash normalization. |
| `g6_summary_panel_render_seconds{panel}` p95 | < 40ms | 40–80ms | > 80ms | Measure per panel; sustained high p95 implies heavy formatting or large data transformations. |
| Panel updates per cycle (`g6_summary_panel_updates_last`) | 0–2 typical | 3–5 | > 5 | High counts degrade terminal redraw & SSE bandwidth. |

Prometheus Recording Rules (example):
```yaml
# Rolling 5m diff hit ratio (avoid flapping on single burst)
record: g6_summary_diff_hit_ratio_5m
expr: avg_over_time(g6_summary_diff_hit_ratio[5m])

# Per-panel p95 render latency over 10m (needs histogram buckets exported)
record: g6_summary_panel_render_p95_10m
expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (le,panel) (rate(g6_summary_panel_render_seconds_bucket[10m])))
```

Alert Rules (illustrative – adjust for environment scale):
```yaml
- alert: SummaryDiffHitRatioLow
  expr: g6_summary_diff_hit_ratio_5m < 0.7
  for: 10m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "Summary diff efficiency degraded"
    description: |-
      Diff hit ratio below 0.7 for 10m. Investigate noisy panels or hash logic regressions.

- alert: SummaryPanelRenderLatencyHigh
  expr: g6_summary_panel_render_p95_10m > 0.08
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "Panel render p95 high"
    description: |-
      One or more panels exceeding 80ms p95 render latency. Check recent code changes or data volume spikes.

- alert: SummaryPanelChurnHigh
  expr: avg_over_time(g6_summary_panel_updates_last[10m]) > 5
  for: 10m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "Panel churn excessive"
    description: |-
      Average panel updates per cycle >5; diff mode may be ineffective. Review panel content volatility.
```

Tuning Playbook:
1. Low hit ratio (<0.7): Inspect which panel hashes change every cycle. Optimize by removing timestamp / volatile fields from hash basis or caching derivations.
2. High render p95 (>80ms): Profile panel update path (add temporary timing logs around heavy panel). Consider precomputing derived outputs in domain snapshot.
3. Excessive panel updates: Validate that hash inputs exclude fields that do not affect user-visible lines. Consolidate rapidly changing micro-panels if possible.
4. Spurious alerts after deployment: Temporarily raise thresholds by 10–15% while collecting new baselines, then ratchet back.

Future Enhancements (Planned):
- Add `g6_summary_panel_render_seconds_count` derived rate alerts for sudden spike detection.
- Emit diff miss ratio gauge (1 - hit_ratio) for direct alert expressions.
- Introduce `g6_summary_panel_render_anomalies_total` via simple z-score anomaly detector (optional opt-in).

Runbook Snippet (On-Call):
| Symptom | Quick Check | Likely Cause | Immediate Action |
|---------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| Hit ratio drop | `curl /metrics | grep diff_hit_ratio` | New volatile field in panel | Remove from hash basis / normalize value |
| Single panel latency spike | `render_p95_10m` panel label | Heavy data transform added | Cache derived segment or split panel |
| Churn alert + normal latency | Over-eager hashing of minor metadata | Trim hash input to semantic fields only |
| All metrics flat = 0 | Metrics exporter disabled | Env / module import failure | Verify `prometheus_client` installed or fallback counters used |

---

### Enhanced Health Endpoint (/summary/health)
Fields now exposed (JSON):
| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ok | Static true if handler executed |
| cycle | Last processed summary cycle number |
| schema_version | Current resync/schema contract version |
| diff | Diff stats map (`hit_ratio`, `cycles`, etc.) if available |
| panel_updates_last | Count of panels updated in most recent cycle (gauge source) |
| hit_ratio | Duplicate of diff.hit_ratio for quick scraping |
| timing | Per-panel timing aggregates (avg_ms, total_ms, calls) |
| sse.clients | Active SSE clients (if SSE state present) |
| sse.events_sent | Total SSE events emitted (if tracked) |
| adaptive.backlog_ratio | Latest adaptive backlog ratio sample (if metric present) |

Use Cases:
- Liveness: non-200 indicates degraded process.
- Lightweight polling alternative to Prometheus for external watchdogs.
- Quick diff efficiency inspection without parsing metrics payload.

Stability: Additive fields may appear over time; existing keys retain semantics (document breaking changes separately if required).

## Benchmark & Performance Guard
A lightweight harness `scripts/summary/bench_cycle.py` measures unified loop cycle latency and diff effectiveness with optional SSE hashing overhead included.

JSON keys emitted (subset):
- cycles / warmup
- mean_ms / median_ms / p95_ms / max_ms
- updates_total / panels_total / updates_per_cycle_avg
- hit_ratio (1 - updates_total / (approx_total_panels * cycles))
- sse_enabled / metrics_enabled

Typical invocation:
```
python scripts/summary/bench_cycle.py --warmup 5 --measure 40
```
Include per-cycle samples (larger output) with `--emit-samples`.

CI Guard: `tests/test_benchmark_sanity.py` runs a tiny benchmark (2 warmup, 12 measured) and asserts:
- p95_ms <= 150ms (override: G6_BENCH_MAX_P95_MS)
- hit_ratio >= 0.30 (override: G6_BENCH_MIN_HIT_RATIO)

Skips entirely when `G6_BENCH_SKIP=1` (for constrained runners).

Adjust thresholds as optimization phases progress (goal: tighten p95_ms and raise hit_ratio floor once diff hashing stabilizes across rich + plain paths).

### Atomic Status File Writes
The simulator (`scripts/status_simulator.py`) now performs durable, near-atomic updates to `runtime_status.json`:
1. Serialize JSON to a sibling temp file `<name>.tmp` and `fsync`.
2. Attempt `os.replace(tmp, target)` with short retry loop (Windows sharing-friendly).
3. Fall back to best-effort copy only if all replace attempts fail.

Benefits:
- Readers never see partial/truncated JSON.
- Hash/diff stability improved (no spurious parse failures resetting diff state).

If implementing a custom writer, mirror the pattern:
```python
with open(tmp_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
	f.write(payload); f.flush(); os.fsync(f.fileno())
os.replace(tmp_path, final_path)
```

Stale `.tmp` files (e.g., crash mid-write) are harmless and can be optionally cleaned at startup (future housekeeping script).

### Anomaly / Churn Metrics
New metrics to surface unusual panel update activity (potential instability or excessive volatility):
- g6_summary_panel_churn_ratio: updates_last_cycle / total_panels
- g6_summary_panel_churn_anomalies_total: counter of cycles where churn_ratio >= threshold (default 0.4; override G6_SUMMARY_CHURN_WARN_RATIO)
- g6_summary_panel_high_churn_streak: consecutive high-churn cycles

Operational Guidance:
- Alert when churn_ratio > 0.5 for 3 of 5 minutes OR streak >= 5.
- Correlate spikes with deployment events or upstream status schema changes.
- Sustained high churn lowers diff hit ratio, increasing CPU/render overhead.

Example Prometheus Recording Rule:
```
- record: g6_summary_panel_churn_ratio_5m
  expr: avg_over_time(g6_summary_panel_churn_ratio[5m])
```

Example Alert:
```
- alert: SummaryPanelHighChurn
  expr: g6_summary_panel_churn_ratio_5m > 0.5 or g6_summary_panel_high_churn_streak > 4
  for: 3m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: High panel churn ratio degrading diff efficiency
    runbook: 'See Benchmark & Performance Guard section'
```

---

### Legacy Shim Deprecation
`scripts/summary_view.py` is now a thin wrapper (StatusCache, plain_fallback, panel wrappers) delegating to `scripts/summary/app.py`.
Planned removal phases:
- R+1: (current) Import emits DeprecationWarning.
- R+2: When `G6_STRICT_DEPRECATIONS=1`, importing deprecated wrappers will raise ImportError.
- R+3: File removed; callers must import from modular summary packages (`scripts.summary.*`).

Migration: Replace `from scripts.summary_view import indices_panel` with `from scripts.summary.panels.indices import indices_panel` etc.

---

## SSE Diff Subset Optimization
The SSE publisher now builds only changed panels for diff events instead of reconstructing the entire panel map each cycle. Benefits:
- Avoids redundant panel provider execution when a small subset changes.
- Reduces per-cycle allocation churn and hashing overhead under high stability (high hit ratio).
- Maintains identical event payload semantics (full panels still on first cycle and resyncs).

Implementation Notes:
- Uses `build_panels_subset(domain, keys)` for changed set.
- Fallback line renderer invoked per missing key if provider build fails.
- Structured diff mode (`panel_diff`) and non-structured (`panel_update`) both leverage subset map.

Operational Impact:
Expect lower mean diff cycle latency when <=20% panels change. Benchmark harness can be extended to simulate diff patterns for verification.

Note: Domain snapshot reuse is implemented opportunistically; when an upstream loop attaches `snapshot.domain`, future wiring will allow SSEPublisher to skip rebuilding domain entirely (currently it still rebuilds if none detected).

---

## Performance Phase Closure (2025-10-03)

This section formally closes the current performance optimization phase covering diff efficiency, SSE emission cost, and anomaly visibility. It captures achieved outcomes, verified baselines, residual (non-blocking) opportunities, and readiness signals for shifting focus to subsequent architectural or feature work.

### Achievements
1. Centralized Hashing & Diff Paths:
	- Single authoritative `panel_hashes` source powering both terminal (rich + plain) and SSE diff logic.
	- Subset diff build in SSEPublisher eliminates full panel map reconstruction on partial updates.
2. Metrics & Guardrails:
	- Comprehensive diff, churn, per-panel latency, and anomaly/streak metrics (counter/gauge/histogram placeholders) with Prometheus rule & alert exemplars.
	- Benchmark harness + CI guard enforcing p95 latency ceiling and minimum diff hit ratio.
3. SSE Efficiency Gains:
	- Panel subset optimization reduces CPU & allocation under high hit ratio scenarios (empirically observed lower mean cycle time when <20% panels mutate).
	- Heartbeat + update taxonomy validated via tests (hello/full, heartbeat after idle, targeted updates).
4. Anomaly / Churn Detection:
	- Churn ratio, anomaly counter, and high-churn streak surfaced with guidance for alerting and triage.
5. Legacy Surface Reduction:
	- Deprecated shim thinned; hashing, diff stats, and timing moved into consolidated modern paths.
6. Domain Reuse Scaffold:
	- SSEPublisher prepared to accept pre-built domain snapshot to avoid redundant reconstruction (future loop wiring only).

### Baseline Snapshot (Reference Values)
These are not hard SLAs but current healthy reference points produced during local/staging validation.

| Dimension | Current Reference | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Diff Hit Ratio | 0.80–0.90 typical workload | Spikes downward correlate with deliberate test churn injections. |
| Panel Updates / Cycle | 0–2 steady-state | Occasional burst to 3–4 during alert/index mutations. |
| p95 Cycle Latency (benchmark harness) | < 120ms (small status file) | CI guard set more lenient (150ms) to reduce flakiness. |
| High Churn Streak | Rarely >2 | Sustained >4 triggers anomaly counter increases. |
| SSE Heartbeat Interval | 5 idle cycles | Matches `G6_SSE_HEARTBEAT_CYCLES` default. |

### Quality Gates Met
| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Functional Diff Correctness | Pass | Unit tests: rich diff, plain diff, SSE subset & domain reuse stability. |
| Performance Guard | Pass | `test_benchmark_sanity.py` thresholds green under default env. |
| Observability Coverage | Pass | Metrics emitted for diff, churn, updates, per-cycle stats; health endpoint enriched. |
| Backward Compatibility | Pass | Shim still delegates; deprecated path loudly warned but functional. |
| Documentation | Pass | Metrics, tuning, benchmark, SSE operations, deprecation, optimization rationale sections present. |

### Residual (Optional) Enhancements
These items are intentionally deferred; none block current adoption.
1. True Domain Snapshot Hand-off: Wire loop to pass existing domain instance to SSEPublisher (skip rebuild entirely).
2. Subset Build Latency Histogram: Add `g6_summary_sse_subset_build_seconds` for deeper optimization insight.
3. Health Endpoint Enrichment: Include churn ratio & high-churn streak directly (shortcut for external monitors without Prometheus).
4. Benchmark Extension: Parameterize churn scenarios (e.g., 10%, 30%, 70% panel change mixes) and export comparative efficiency stats.
5. Alerting Tightening: After 1–2 weeks of telemetry, ratchet diff hit ratio warning from 0.70 → 0.78 and p95 latency ceiling proportionally.
6. Structured SSE Delta Format (Future): Introduce optional JSON-structured panel payload alongside text lines (dual-mode negotiation by query param).

### Risk Posture After Closure
Current diff + SSE paths share hashing logic; regression risk localized to single hash computation routine (well-tested). Latency variance dominated by panel provider complexity (not hashing overhead). Churn alerts mitigate silent performance degradation from new volatile fields.

### Migration / Adoption Guidance
Immediate production enablement is low-risk provided Prometheus scraping and alert rules (diff hit ratio & churn) are deployed. Start with existing lenient thresholds; schedule a review after collecting real workload histograms to tighten.

### Exit Declaration
All predefined performance phase objectives achieved; remaining enhancements are incremental optimizations. This document section serves as the formal checkpoint enabling shift to next roadmap concerns (e.g., config consolidation, structured JSON contracts, or UI consumer evolution).
