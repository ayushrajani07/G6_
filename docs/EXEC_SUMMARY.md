# G6 Recent Enhancements – Executive Summary

_Last updated: 2025-09-27_

## Scope
This summary captures the latest platform improvements spanning adaptive control, analytics instrumentation, and data lifecycle hygiene. It is intended for engineering leads and operations stakeholders needing a concise impact view.

## Key Deliverables
| Area | Enhancement | Value / Impact |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Adaptive Control | Multi-signal controller (`adaptive.logic`) leveraging SLA breach streak, memory pressure, cardinality guard; adds flapping protection (cooldowns) | Sustains SLA under load while preventing oscillations in option detail tiering |
| Adaptive Control | Action audit & mode emission (`g6_adaptive_controller_actions_total`, `g6_option_detail_mode`) | Transparent reasoning + PromQL friendly states for dashboards/alerts |
| Vol Surface Analytics | Quality heuristic (`g6_vol_surface_quality_score`), interpolation latency histogram, model timing scaffold | Faster root-cause on deteriorating data density & future model performance tuning |
| Vol Surface Analytics | Deterministic interpolation test ensures instrumentation stability | Prevents silent regressions in phase-level timing metrics |
| Risk Aggregation | Bucket utilization gauge | Early detection of structural gaps / config mismatches |
| Metrics Governance | Group gating + introspection (`g6_metric_group_state{group}`) extended to storage & adaptive | Cardinality defense + controlled observability cost |
| Data Lifecycle | Compression + quarantine scan job stub with retention pruning & metrics (`g6_compressed_files_total`, `g6_quarantine_scan_seconds`, `g6_retention_files_deleted_total`) | Curbs storage growth and sets foundation for automated hygiene policies |
| Reliability | Cooldown env flags (`G6_ADAPTIVE_DEMOTE_COOLDOWN`, `G6_ADAPTIVE_PROMOTE_COOLDOWN`) | Stabilizes mode transitions, reducing churn risk |
| Documentation | Roadmap change log & env dict updates | Maintains governance (zero undocumented env drift) |

## New / Updated Environment Flags
```
G6_ADAPTIVE_MAX_SLA_BREACH_STREAK  (demotion sensitivity)
G6_ADAPTIVE_MIN_HEALTH_CYCLES      (promotion health window)
G6_ADAPTIVE_DEMOTE_COOLDOWN        (cycles between demotions)
G6_ADAPTIVE_PROMOTE_COOLDOWN       (cycles between promotions)
G6_LIFECYCLE_JOB                   (enable lifecycle job)
G6_LIFECYCLE_COMPRESSION_EXT       (target file extensions)
G6_LIFECYCLE_COMPRESSION_AGE_SEC   (min age to compress)
G6_LIFECYCLE_MAX_PER_CYCLE         (compression cap)
G6_LIFECYCLE_QUAR_DIR              (quarantine root)
G6_LIFECYCLE_RETENTION_DAYS        (retention window; 0=off)
G6_LIFECYCLE_RETENTION_DELETE_LIMIT (retention delete cap)
```

## Operational Observability – Suggested Queries
- Adaptive action rate: `sum(rate(g6_adaptive_controller_actions_total[5m])) by (reason,action)`
- Current option detail distribution: `g6_option_detail_mode` (0=full,1=band,2=agg)
- Vol surface quality trend: `avg_over_time(g6_vol_surface_quality_score[15m]) by (index)`
- Interpolation latency p95: `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(g6_vol_surface_interp_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))`
- Storage compression velocity: `increase(g6_compressed_files_total[1h])`
- Retention deletions: `increase(g6_retention_files_deleted_total[24h])`

## Risk & Follow-Up Recommendations
| Category | Risk | Mitigation Next Step |
|----------|------|----------------------|
| Adaptive Over-Demotion | Heuristic still coarse (no gradation by pressure source weight) | Add weighted scoring + per-signal counters |
| Surface Quality Semantics | Heuristic lacks absolute scale definition | Document formal scoring formula & add alert thresholds |
| Retention Accuracy | Simulated compression may misrepresent real size savings | Implement true gzip + size delta gauge |
| Cardinality Guard Interaction | Guard trips currently binary demote path | Introduce partial metrics suppression tier before full demote |

## Planned Near-Term Enhancements
1. True compression size accounting (`g6_compression_bytes_saved_total`).
2. Adaptive signal weighting & decay model.
3. Retention dry-run mode + deletion audit log.
4. Promotion/demotion decision snapshot event payloads for panel display.

## Summary
These changes establish a resilient adaptive layer, finer-grained analytics introspection, and foundational lifecycle hygiene with minimal operational risk. The system is better instrumented for proactive degradation detection and controlled resource consumption.
