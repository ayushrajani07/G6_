"""Post-initialization recovery helpers for `MetricsRegistry`.

This module centralizes late fallback logic for a few metrics whose
registration can be skipped in rare edge cases (predicate gating,
import ordering failures, or optional subsystem inactivity during
startup). The goal is to keep `metrics.py` lean while preserving
observability guarantees expected by tests and operators.

Current responsibilities (minimal by design):
- panel_diff_truncated counter: ensures presence when panel diff
  instrumentation group was enabled but spec/group path skipped.
- vol_surface_quality_score gauge: only when analytics_vol_surface
  group is allowed (avoids spurious series when analytics disabled).
- events_last_full_unixtime gauge: provides a fresh timestamp even if
  the event bus lazy registration hasn't yet occurred before a test
  inspects the registry.

Design principles:
1. Idempotent: All operations check attribute existence before creating.
2. Best-effort: Swallow unexpected exceptions unless strict mode is enabled.
3. Narrow scope: Do not add broader category/performance recovery hereâ€”those
   are handled deterministically earlier in initialization.
